## 📦 Pack Info

A lightweight resource pack that makes the world look bright by removing heavy fog and boosting clarity — **no commands, no behavior packs, achievements stay ON**.

If you want brightness without turning on cheats (and without running /effect), this pack is for you. It pairs nicely with x-ray resource packs and works on Realms/servers that allow resource packs.

## 📦 What's Inside

- `manifest.json`
- `biomes_client.json` — points every biome to our fog preset
- `fogs/fullbright.json` — bright, low-fog visuals for air/weather/water/lava
- `pack_icon.png`

## 🧠 Why This Pack Matters

- **Cheats OFF / Achievements ON** — works without commands, so it’s legit-friendly.  
- **Multiplayer/Realms friendly** — as long as the server/realm allows resource packs.  
- **Stacks with other packs** — use it with x-ray or texture packs; just set the **pack order** (see below).

> ⚠️ **Note:** Resource packs can’t change actual light levels. Caves may still look dark compared to true Night Vision. For “real” brightness underground, use a **Night Vision behavior pack** (cheats ON)

## 🔨 How to Use It

**Import**
1. Download the mcpack file and click to import

**World-only activation**
1. From the main menu, click **Edit** on your world.
2. Go to **Resource Packs → Available → FullBright (Cheats OFF)** → **Activate**.
3. In **Active**, drag **FullBright** to the **top**
4. Load the world. Done.

**Global activation (applies to all worlds)**
- **Settings → Global Resources →** activate **FullBright** and move it to the top.

**Using with X-Ray or other packs**
- Activate **both** packs.
- In **Active**, put **FullBright above** your x-ray pack so its fog changes win while x-ray textures still work.

**On Realms**
- Realm owner: **Edit Realm → Resource Packs** → upload/activate **FullBright**.
- (Optional) Enable “require/force pack” so all players use it automatically.
